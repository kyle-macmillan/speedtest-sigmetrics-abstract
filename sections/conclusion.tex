\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper provided an in-depth comparison of \ookla and \ndt, focusing on
both test design and infrastructure. Our measurements, both under controlled
network conditions and wide area network using paired tests, present new
insights about the differences in behavior of the two tools. Yet, while this
work is the {\em first} to perform such a controlled and extensive comparison
between these speed test tools, we neither hope nor expect that it will be the
last, and note that many important questions remain, both in the technical and policy
realms.  In the paper, we also discuss the implications of our findings for the future of
speed test tools and data analysis and outline multiple avenues for
future work.
