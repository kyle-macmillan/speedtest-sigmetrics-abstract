\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We observe significant 
differences in 
Ookla and NDT7â€™s behavior and explain the causes of these differences in the
full paper~\cite{macmillan2023}. Our results and 
suggestions should help users understand why the reported speed from Ookla and NDT7 may 
differ, as well as guide policymakers towards 
more accurate and appropriate  use of public data sets based on these tools.  To facilitate 
both the  reproduction and extension of  our
results and study, we have released all of the data from this study, as well
as all of the measurement and analysis code we used to conduct the 
study~\cite{netrics-code,netrics-data}. 

While this work is the {\em first} to perform such a controlled and extensive
comparison between these speed test tools, we neither hope nor expect that it
will be the last, and note that many important questions remain, both in the
technical and policy realms. We view this research as the beginning of a
discussion on how to use collective speed test data to shed more light on the
state of broadband Internet access networks around the United States, and the
world.

In the paper, we also discuss the implications of our findings for the future of
speed test tools and data analysis and outline multiple avenues for future work.
